I am a master's student at the University of Southern California (USC)✌️. I am studying Applied Data Science at USC's Viterbi School of Engineering.


Before coming to USC, I studied Mathematics at Santa Clara University 🐎, which is where I first developed interest in data science. I was first introduced to the imortance of data through courses such as Probability and Statistics, Cosmology, and Mathematical Finance. During that time, data science as a field was developing at an exponential rate, and I wanted to see what it was all about! 📈💯


A little bit about me...

- 🌱 I’m currently learning Data Mining and Database Systems. I've previously took courses on Machine Learning, Predictive Analytics, Big Data, Data Management, and programming in Python!
- 👩🏻‍💻 Over the summer of 2022, I worked at Intel as a Software Technical Consulting Engineer Intern. I got to leverage my skills in python to work on various interesting projects.
- ⚡ I am interested in statisticical/machine learning, data analysis, and databases and am looking for relevant opportunities!
- 🌞 During my free time, I like to go to CorePower yoga, try new restaurants, read about horoscopes, go on hikes, or go for a drive (I finally got my license this year 😎)
