I am a master's student at the University of Southern California (USC). 👩🏻‍💻 I am studying Applied Data Science at USC's Viterbi School of Engineering.

Before coming to USC, I studied Mathematics at Santa Clara University, which is where I first developed interest in Data Science. I was first introduced to the imortance of data through courses such as Probability and Statistics, Cosmology, and Mathematical Finance. During that time, data Science as a field was developing at an exponential rate, and I wanted to see what it was all about! 📈💯

- 🌱 I’m currently learning Machine Learning for Data Science and Predictive Analytics. I've previously took courses on Big Data, Data Management, and programming in Python!
- 🌞 Over the summer of 2022, I worked at Intel as a Software Technical Consulting Engineer Intern. I got to leverage my skills in python to work on various interesting projects.
- ⚡ I am interested in statistics, data analytics, and databases and am looking for relevant opportunities!
